Scrum Specific Planning Exercise

# Scenario
The development team for a major clothing retailer has been using the scrum framework to manage the delivery of their work for over a year.

The team adjusts the length of time of their sprints depending on the amount of work going on. The team will have longer sprints (3-4 weeks) during parts of the year and as the team approaches release dates, they have shorter sprints (1-2 weeks).

# Question 
Based on the scenario, what impacts would this have on the team?

# My Solution
As the team approaches release dates, having shorter sprints than usual can cause the team to make wrong decisions about their estimates like velocity and the team might not take into account the other additional factors like maternity leaves, off sites etc. This might hinder the release. 

# Example Answers
The team needs to choose the length of time their sprints should last and not change them. Changing sprint durations throughout the year will prevent the team from establishing a velocity. Without a velocity the team will not be able to plan releases or be predictable about work.

Changing sprint lengths will also prevent the team from establishing predictability. Good Agile teams can make highly accurate predictions about when work will be complete. Without an established sprint duration the team can never reach highly accurate predictions.
