Scrum Specific Planning Exercise

# Scenario
The development team for a major clothing retailer has been using the scrum framework to manage the delivery of their work for over a year.

The team adjusts the length of time of their sprints depending on the amount of work going on. The team will have longer sprints (3-4 weeks) during parts of the year and as the team approaches release dates, they have shorter sprints (1-2 weeks).

# Question 
Based on the scenario, what impacts would this have on the team?
