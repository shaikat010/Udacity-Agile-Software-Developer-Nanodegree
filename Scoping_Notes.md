2. Estimation Techniques
3. Defining Done

### Why does scoping matter?

Scoping is Important because:

1. Product Owner can prioritise
2. Provides understanding for teams
3. Team can estimate
4. Stories can be "split" where needed

#### Approach to Scoping and Estimcation

1.Fast
2.Easy
3.Expose Unknown
4.Relative

In Agile, requirements or scope are represented by user stories and in order to plan and prioritize effectively the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development team must understand the scope of the work.

The team can estimate more effectively if they have a good understanding of the work before they begin development. Scoping and estimating should be a team exercise where the team discusses the work with the Product Owner to ensure they understand what they are being asked to build. Scoping and estimating should be fast, easy, expose unknowns, and estimates should be relative.

It's important to be careful not to let Product Owners, customers, or stakeholders dictate scope or estimates because it will hurt the quality of the product. Itâ€™s also very important that priority comes from one person and that person should be the Product Owner
