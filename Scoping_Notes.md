# Introduction to Scoping

Here we will be learning about scoping, estimation, and what "Done" means in the context of an Agile product.

### Lesson Overview

Lesson Overview - Scoping
In this lesson we will cover Intro to Scoping and Estimation, Estimation Techniques, Defining "Done". This will build off the Agile Planning and Prioritization lesson and prepare you for the subsequent lessons on Release and Iteration Planning.

By the End of the Lesson You Will Be Able To:

Understand how to control the scope of user stories
Refine the Definition of Done for user stories
Estimate user stories
Explain and apply various estimation techniques
Apply ideal time to estimates



### What is Scoping ?

Finding the right size of the work and estimation


### What is covered further:

1. Introduction to scoping and estimation
2. Estimation Techniques
3. Defining Done

### Why does scoping matter?

Scoping is Important because:

1. Product Owner can prioritise
2. Provides understanding for teams
3. Team can estimate
4. Stories can be "split" where needed

### Approach to Scoping and Estimation

1.Fast
2.Easy
3.Expose Unknown
4.Relative

In Agile, requirements or scope are represented by user stories and in order to plan and prioritize effectively the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development team must understand the scope of the work.

The team can estimate more effectively if they have a good understanding of the work before they begin development. Scoping and estimating should be a team exercise where the team discusses the work with the Product Owner to ensure they understand what they are being asked to build. Scoping and estimating should be fast, easy, expose unknowns, and estimates should be relative.

It's important to be careful not to let Product Owners, customers, or stakeholders dictate scope or estimates because it will hurt the quality of the product. It’s also very important that priority comes from one person and that person should be the Product Owner

# Scoping and Estimation

Measuring the scope of work that needs to be completed is a key component to creating tactical plans for doing the work and is a major factor in the Product Owner's prioritization process. The development team provides relative estimates for each user story to measure the scope of work and they take Complexity, Size, Level of Effort, and Certainty into account when estimating. Most Agile teams use story points as the unit of measure to provide estimates. The team’s estimates are always relative because of all the factors being considered, instead of exact measures such as hours, days, minutes, etc. Only the people doing the work can estimate the work and relative estimates should always be based on ideal time.

Relative Estimates
Here is an example of relative estimates in which you can see in this comparison bricks (1) is estimated as the smallest and least complex, but the complexity grows from a house (3), fire station (8), hotel (13), and finally a city (21). The city is the largest and most complex relative to the options and numbers present.

New Definitions
Relative Estimating - the art of estimating the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort for a user story, based on the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort of another user story
Story Points - The numerical units of measure that agile teams use to represent the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort for user stories
Ideal Time - The amount of time it would take to complete a user story without any distractions or disruptions
