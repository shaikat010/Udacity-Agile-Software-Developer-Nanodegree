By the End of the Lesson You Will Be Able To:

Understand how to control the scope of user stories
Refine the Definition of Done for user stories
Estimate user stories
Explain and apply various estimation techniques
Apply ideal time to estimates



### What is Scoping ?

Finding the right size of the work and estimation


### What is covered further:

1. Introduction to scoping and estimation
2. Estimation Techniques
3. Defining Done

### Why does scoping matter?

Scoping is Important because:

1. Product Owner can prioritise
2. Provides understanding for teams
3. Team can estimate
4. Stories can be "split" where needed

### Approach to Scoping and Estimation

1.Fast
2.Easy
3.Expose Unknown
4.Relative

In Agile, requirements or scope are represented by user stories and in order to plan and prioritize effectively the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development team must understand the scope of the work.

The team can estimate more effectively if they have a good understanding of the work before they begin development. Scoping and estimating should be a team exercise where the team discusses the work with the Product Owner to ensure they understand what they are being asked to build. Scoping and estimating should be fast, easy, expose unknowns, and estimates should be relative.

It's important to be careful not to let Product Owners, customers, or stakeholders dictate scope or estimates because it will hurt the quality of the product. It’s also very important that priority comes from one person and that person should be the Product Owner

# Scoping and Estimation

## How scoping works

1. The product owner adds and prioritizes user stories in the backlog
2. The Product Owner and team discuss the work together during a planning meeting
3. The team provides a relative estimate for each user story

## Relative Estimates in Agile Planning

1. The process of applying estimates by considering size, complexity, level of effort and unknown
2. Softwares cannot be estimated in absolutes or exact measurements
3. Most ofter teams use story points to represent relative story points

## Story Points

1. Tools used to provide relative estimates that represent scope
2. Drive consensus and conversation to ensure understanding
3. Numbers are relative and not equal to days, hours, minutes etc
4. Have different meanings from team to team
5. Used to determine velocity of teams

## Components of user story estimates

1. Complexity
2. Size
3. Level of Effort
4. Unknowns

## More on Estimates

1. Estimation is done during planning ceremonies/ meetings
2. Estimates are done in ideal time
3. Big estimates are an indicatior of too much complexity and too many unknowns (>8)
4. Smaller estimates indicate the team is more certain (<8)
5. **Only the team doing the work can estimate the work**
   

## Reducing Scope

1. User stories should be estimateable (INVEST --> E Missing
2. If estimates are too big, user stories should be split
3. When user stories are split, they do not have to equal the sum of the original estimates

# Teams should estimate user stories in ideal time

## This means the time it would take to complete the user story without any distractions

## Ideal Time

1. Do not factor in time out of the office
2. Do not factor in time spent on responding to emails or IMs
3. Do not factor in meetings, events, happy works etc

# How they relate:

1. Scope is measured using relative estimates
2. Relative estimates are often represented using story points
3. Estimates should be based on ideal time

Measuring the scope of work that needs to be completed is a key component to creating tactical plans for doing the work and is a major factor in the Product Owner's prioritization process. The development team provides relative estimates for each user story to measure the scope of work and they take Complexity, Size, Level of Effort, and Certainty into account when estimating. Most Agile teams use story points as the unit of measure to provide estimates. The team’s estimates are always relative because of all the factors being considered, instead of exact measures such as hours, days, minutes, etc. Only the people doing the work can estimate the work and relative estimates should always be based on ideal time.

Relative Estimates
Here is an example of relative estimates in which you can see in this comparison bricks (1) is estimated as the smallest and least complex, but the complexity grows from a house (3), fire station (8), hotel (13), and finally a city (21). The city is the largest and most complex relative to the options and numbers present.

### New Definitions
Relative Estimating - the art of estimating the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort for a user story, based on the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort of another user story

Story Points - The numerical units of measure that agile teams use to represent the size, scope, complexity, and level of effort for user stories

Ideal Time - The amount of time it would take to complete a user story without any distractions or disruptions

# Estimation Techniques

## Estimation Techniques Covered

1. Planning Poker
2. T-Shirt Sizing
3. Affinity Estimation

## Fibonacci Sequence used for story points --> 0 , 1/2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 20 , 40 , 100

It is not sequencial but has gaps

Used as story points

Forces teams to estimate relatively

## Estimation Technique : Planning Poker

1. Repid technique that is good for products at all phases
2. Team members are given index cards or planning poker cards
3. Cards have the Fabonacci Sequence
4. After the story is discussed and understood by everyone the team points by raising their cards at the same time
5. Misalignment means there is confusion about the user story so more duscussion might be necessary
6. Team repeats if the estimates are not relatively aligned

## Estimation Technique : T-shirt Sizing 

1. Rapid estimation technique
2. Good for projects that are just beginning or that have a lot of unknowns
3. Team uses t-shirt sizes (S,M,L,XL) to estimate
4. Good for estimating epics

## Estimation Techniques : Affinity Estimation

1. Rapid estimation technique
2. Good for new products with a lot of stories to estimate
3. To estimate, team uses t-shirt sizes (S,M,L,XL) coffee cup sizes, or Fabonacci Sequence
4. Team places similar user stories into the same bucket

small bucket --> less complex
large bucket --> more complex

Estimation Technique: T-Shirt Sizing
In this technique t-shirt sizes are used to estimate the complexity of a user story.

Estimation Technique: Affinity Estimation
In this technique we group the user stories in this case into swim lanes using the T-Shirt Sizing to determine the swim lane categories.

# What does "Done" mean ?

### Are we done yet?

a. Definition of Done

b. Unclear Direction

c. Quality Suffers

## Teams Defintion of Done

1. Agile Teams establish a definition of done (DOD) for deeloping software
2. The DOD is the teams agreement for everything that needs to happen for the code to be "done"
3. If the code is not developed to the standard of "done" for the team then they must keep working on it
4. Teams take their definition of done into account when estimating user stories and breaking the user stories into smaller tasks
5. The DOD can vary from company to company and from team to team

## Accpetance Criteria Defition of Done:

1. Acceptance criteria provide the team with the parameters for implementing user stories
2. The acceptance criteria must be met in order for the story to be accpeted as "Done" by the Product Owner
3. This requires conversation and transparency between the team and the Product Owner
4. We demo the working software to the Product Owner to confirm that the acceptance criteria has been met
5. Important to distinguish between the acceptance criteria being met and the Product Owner adding scope

The Definition of Done (DOD) is a critical element to help teams, product owners, and stakeholders communicate. A solid DOD that everyone understands helps provide direction and helps ensure that high-quality software is delivered. Think about the DOD from 2 perspectives:

The Team's Definition of Done is their agreement for everything that needs to happen for the code to be "done". If any of the code is not developed to the standard of “done” that the team has agreed upon, then the team must keep working on it until it is complete. As teams are estimating, they should be considering what it will take to complete user stories according to the team's definition of done.

The Product Owner's Definition of Done comes in the form of acceptance criteria. As you have already learned, acceptance criteria are parameters that guide the implementation of user stories. These parameters can be thought of as the minimum set of criteria that needs to be met for the user story to be considered "done" by the Product Owner. The team demos the working software to the Product Owner to confirm that the acceptance criteria has been met. During demos and conversations about the DOD with the Product Owner, it is important to distinguish between the acceptance criteria being met and the Product Owner adding to the scope. Conversation and transparency are keys to ensuring that the acceptance criteria or DOD is met in all cases.
