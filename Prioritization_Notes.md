# Prioritization Notes

# Why Does Prioritization Matter?

Prioritizing is key to manage all of the customer requirements, features, enhancements and functionality. 
The work must be prioritized so that the team knows what to focus on. In Agile, the processes set up so that quality is built into the software. 
Quality takes time, focus, and attention to detail. 
If the team does not have priority for what they should work on, then it is hard for them to know where to focus their time, efforts, and attention. 
By focusing on the high priority work, the team is not distracted by trying to do "everything," and this focus leads to a higher quality product.

# The main reason is to provide for Build in Quality of the Product!

# Lack of Priority Results in :
1. Too much Scope
2. Poor Quality
3. Unsatisfied Customers
4. Unsuccessful Products

# How Experts think about prioritization:
To begin prioritizing, there are 2 perspectives to consider:

Business Value
Technical Complexity
Business Value
From the perspective of business value we want to prioritize the features that provide the most amount of value to the customer without any other considerations outside of business value.We may ask some of the following questions to help when considering what is a priority and what is not:

What functionality is needed for the product to be successful?
Will they benefit from what we are building?
What is not needed that is being asked for?
Will this make our customer or users happy?
Is this feature or user story actually valuable?
Technical Complexity
From the perspective of technical complexity, we want to prioritize the features that provide the highest value but are the most technically complex. We consider more than just business value when prioritizing. We must also consider the complexity of building the feature.

We want to deliver the simplest things that provide the most amount of value; therefore, we tackle the riskiest components first so that we know the best way to proceed. We work on the hard things, that bring the customer the most value, first.
