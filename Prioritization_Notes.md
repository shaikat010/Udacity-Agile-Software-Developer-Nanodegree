# Prioritization Notes

# Why Does Prioritization Matter?

Prioritizing is key to manage all of the customer requirements, features, enhancements and functionality. 
The work must be prioritized so that the team knows what to focus on. In Agile, the processes set up so that quality is built into the software. 
Quality takes time, focus, and attention to detail. 
If the team does not have priority for what they should work on, then it is hard for them to know where to focus their time, efforts, and attention. 
By focusing on the high priority work, the team is not distracted by trying to do "everything," and this focus leads to a higher quality product.

# The main reason is to provide for Build in Quality of the Product!

# Lack of Priority Results in :
1. Too much Scope
2. Poor Quality
3. Unsatisfied Customers
4. Unsuccessful Products

# How Experts think about prioritization:
To begin prioritizing, there are 2 perspectives to consider:

Business Value
Technical Complexity
Business Value
From the perspective of business value we want to prioritize the features that provide the most amount of value to the customer without any other considerations outside of business value.We may ask some of the following questions to help when considering what is a priority and what is not:

What functionality is needed for the product to be successful?
Will they benefit from what we are building?
What is not needed that is being asked for?
Will this make our customer or users happy?
Is this feature or user story actually valuable?
Technical Complexity
From the perspective of technical complexity, we want to prioritize the features that provide the highest value but are the most technically complex. We consider more than just business value when prioritizing. We must also consider the complexity of building the feature.

We want to deliver the simplest things that provide the most amount of value; therefore, we tackle the riskiest components first so that we know the best way to proceed. We work on the hard things, that bring the customer the most value, first.


# Introduction to Backlogs

What is a product backlog?

1. List of all the remaining work for the product
2. Planning tool for the team developing the product
3. Contains users stories, features and epics for a product
4. Centralsied and Prioritized TO-DO List for the Product

The product backlog is the team’s to-do list and is owned by the Product Owner. The backlog is where all the work (Epics, Features, & User Stories) remaining to be done for the product is kept. The Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master all interact with the backlog; however, the Product Owner has the final say on the priority of the work in the backlog.

New Definitions
Product Backlog - The work remaining to be completed for the product. The Product Owner is the primary owner of the product backlog and is primarily responsible for owning it. In Scrum, the product backlog is considered one of the three main artifacts the team uses to manage work.

# Product Owner and the Backlog

1. Owns the product backlog
2. Single point of contact that prioritises the backlog
3. Adds detailed user stories that are ready to be implemented
4. Adds stories, features and epics that are to be implemented in the future
5. Adds feature request from the customer to the backlog
6. Cleans the product backlog by removing stories or features that won't be implemented

# The Development Team and the Backlog

1. Queue for the work to be completed
2. Pulls in work; single source of work
3. Adds technical related stories / tasks to the backlog when needed
4. Estimates stories so that product onwer can prioritise them

# Scrum Master and the Backlog

1. Assist product owner with management and prioritization
2. Ensure team works in the right stories
3. Protects the team from external distractions

# Backlog is continuously changing, evolving and never ending!


# Managing and Organising the Backlog



The backlog must be properly managed and organized by the Product Owner in order for the team to know “what” should be worked on next. The Product Owner ensures that the backlog is kept up to date and always reflects the current priorities for the product using a technique called Progressive Elaboration. User stories that are high priority for the product are moved to the top of the backlog and detailed appropriately to meet the INVEST criteria and user stories that are lower priority are moved to the bottom of the backlog.

### Progressive Elaboration
Combine the backlog and any new user stories. Then prioritize user stories to the top of the backlog the items of high priority, well defined, and finer granularity. While the low priority, not well defined, and courses granularity user stories will be at the bottom of the backlog.

# A good product backlog is one that is Detailed Appropriately, Estimatible, Emergent, and Prioritized.

### Good Product Backlog: DEEP
The key aspects of a good product backlog are being Detailed Appropriately, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized.

New Definitions
DEEP - An acronym that stands for Detailed Appropriately, Estimatible, Emergent, and Prioritized. DEEP outlines the preferable attributes of a backlog.
Progressive Elaboration - The process of defining high priority user stories and arranging them at the top of the backlog and moving lesser defined-lower priority stories and features to the bottom of the backlog.
