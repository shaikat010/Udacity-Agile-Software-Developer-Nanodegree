# Prioritization Notes

# Why Does Prioritization Matter?

Prioritizing is key to manage all of the customer requirements, features, enhancements and functionality. 
The work must be prioritized so that the team knows what to focus on. In Agile, the processes set up so that quality is built into the software. 
Quality takes time, focus, and attention to detail. 
If the team does not have priority for what they should work on, then it is hard for them to know where to focus their time, efforts, and attention. 
By focusing on the high priority work, the team is not distracted by trying to do "everything," and this focus leads to a higher quality product.

# The main reason is to provide for Build in Quality of the Product!

# Lack of Priority Results in :
1. Too much Scope
2. Poor Quality
3. Unsatisfied Customers
4. Unsuccessful Products

# How Experts think about prioritization:
To begin prioritizing, there are 2 perspectives to consider:

Business Value
Technical Complexity
Business Value
From the perspective of business value we want to prioritize the features that provide the most amount of value to the customer without any other considerations outside of business value.We may ask some of the following questions to help when considering what is a priority and what is not:

What functionality is needed for the product to be successful?
Will they benefit from what we are building?
What is not needed that is being asked for?
Will this make our customer or users happy?
Is this feature or user story actually valuable?
Technical Complexity
From the perspective of technical complexity, we want to prioritize the features that provide the highest value but are the most technically complex. We consider more than just business value when prioritizing. We must also consider the complexity of building the feature.

We want to deliver the simplest things that provide the most amount of value; therefore, we tackle the riskiest components first so that we know the best way to proceed. We work on the hard things, that bring the customer the most value, first.


# Introduction to Backlogs

What is a product backlog?

1. List of all the remaining work for the product
2. Planning tool for the team developing the product
3. Contains users stories, features and epics for a product
4. Centralsied and Prioritized TO-DO List for the Product

The product backlog is the team’s to-do list and is owned by the Product Owner. The backlog is where all the work (Epics, Features, & User Stories) remaining to be done for the product is kept. The Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master all interact with the backlog; however, the Product Owner has the final say on the priority of the work in the backlog.

New Definitions
Product Backlog - The work remaining to be completed for the product. The Product Owner is the primary owner of the product backlog and is primarily responsible for owning it. In Scrum, the product backlog is considered one of the three main artifacts the team uses to manage work.

# Product Owner and the Backlog

1. Owns the product backlog
2. Single point of contact that prioritises the backlog
3. Adds detailed user stories that are ready to be implemented
4. Adds stories, features and epics that are to be implemented in the future
5. Adds feature request from the customer to the backlog
6. Cleans the product backlog by removing stories or features that won't be implemented

# The Development Team and the Backlog

1. Queue for the work to be completed
2. Pulls in work; single source of work
3. Adds technical related stories / tasks to the backlog when needed
4. Estimates stories so that product onwer can prioritise them

# Scrum Master and the Backlog

1. Assist product owner with management and prioritization
2. Ensure team works in the right stories
3. Protects the team from external distractions

# Backlog is continuously changing, evolving and never ending!


# Managing and Organising the Backlog

The backlog is continuously evolving and changing
Product Owner must ensure that it is organised and well maintained.

Good Product Backlog : DEEP 

D --> Detailed Appropriately
E --> Estimated
E --> Emergent
P --> Prioritized

### Adjust the Backlog for Risk

1. Stories are added to the backlog that are of highest value
2. Determine what stories present the most rosk
3. User stories with the highest value that present the highest risk are prioritized first in the backlog

#### The top of the Backlog 

1. Highest Priority User Stories
2. Well Defined User Stories
3. Higher risk user stories
4. Ready to be implemented
5. INVEST Criteria applied to stories

#### The bottom of the backlog

1. Lower priority user stories
2. Lower risk user stories
3. User stories that are not well defined
4. INVEST criteria not fully applied to the stories


#### Split stories that are too big

#### Split Stories when: 
1. Too complex or too big
2. Dependencies are present
3. Not able to estimate
4. INVEST Criteria not met

The backlog must be properly managed and organized by the Product Owner in order for the team to know “what” should be worked on next. The Product Owner ensures that the backlog is kept up to date and always reflects the current priorities for the product using a technique called Progressive Elaboration. User stories that are high priority for the product are moved to the top of the backlog and detailed appropriately to meet the INVEST criteria and user stories that are lower priority are moved to the bottom of the backlog.

### Progressive Elaboration
Combine the backlog and any new user stories. Then prioritize user stories to the top of the backlog the items of high priority, well defined, and finer granularity. While the low priority, not well defined, and courses granularity user stories will be at the bottom of the backlog.

# A good product backlog is one that is Detailed Appropriately, Estimatible, Emergent, and Prioritized.

### Good Product Backlog: DEEP
The key aspects of a good product backlog are being Detailed Appropriately, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized.

Progressive Elaboration - The process of defining high priority user stories and arranging them at the top of the backlog and moving lesser defined-lower priority stories and features to the bottom of the backlog.

# Prioritization Techniques

COnsiderations for Prioritization:
1. Cost
2. Time
3. Technical Complexity
4. Customer Satisfaction

### A Few Techniques:

1. Basic Prioritization
2. MoSCOW
3. Dot Voting
4. Play Money


### Basic Prioritization

Prioritise user sotries based on value alone
User stories are assigned priority levels such as P1, P2 and P3
High priority user stories are assigned P1, and are implemented first
P2 user stories are implemented next and P3 sories are the last

### MoSCOW Method

M --> Must Have
S --> Should Have
C --> Could Have
W --> Won't Have

Can organise the user stories in moscow as a grid and then as swinlane diagrams 

### Dot Voting

User stories or featuresa are posted on a board
Dots represent votes and are given to each person
Each person receives the same number of dots
The number of dots that are given should be less than the number of user stories being voted on
Each person assigns the dots (votes) to the user stories
User stories are prioritised according to the number of dots received

### Play Money

Give each customer /stakeholder/ team member play money that equals the product or project budget
Each person distributes their money on the features for the product
Features are prioritised on the budget they receive

Prioritization can be a tough job for Product Owners because of all the considerations such as time, cost, value, and many others that must be taken into account. There are several techniques including the MoSCoW, Dot Voting, and Play money (Purchase a feature) that Product Owners leverage to prioritize the work for a product.

When using the Dot Voting technique user stories are made visible to everyone then, each person is given an equal amount of Dots (votes). The number of dots given should be less than the number of stories, and good guidance is 20-30% of the total number of stories to force priority. Each person places their dots (votes) anonymously or publicly on the features or user stories they see as the most valuable. User stories are then prioritized according to the highest number of dots (votes) received.

With the Play Money technique each person involved receives money that equals the amount of the budget for the product. User stories and or features are laid out on the table and each person distributes (spends) their money on the things that are most valuable to them. Features are then prioritized according to amount of money received. Features that receive the most money are prioritized the highest.

Prioritization Technique: MoSCoW Method
This is a method where you categorize each item within one of the following categories: Must have features, Should have features, Could have features, Won't have features. The lowercase 'o's make it is easier to remember the acronym.

# Risk and Prioritization Influence

Traditionally projects that have risks that are seen as "good" but in Agile, all risks are seen as threats to the product or projects success, so items that present the most risk are prioritized first to fail fast.

Since risks threaten the product's success, teams embrace failure as an opportunity to learn what does work and this is where failing fast appears. Teams focus on work that is the riskiest first and confront the things that could make them fail, which leads them to overcome failure more quickly, and they learn along the way.

Here are some examples of risks that might be encountered:

Very complex work such as moving data from a data center to the cloud and the data needs to be refined and cleaned to move it to another location.
Inexperienced in a particular subject matter such as, a team being assigned to create a network of blockchains with no prior experience.
You have learned that the product owner is primarily responsible for prioritizing work in the backlog for the team and as the team builds the product their knowledge and understanding of the product grows. The team's understanding and insight gained from being close to the work allows them to give the product owner feedback about priorities. The product owner leverages the team's knowledge and insight and often partners to prioritize the backlog together.

### Prioritization Influence Evolution
Over time, a team moves from being new to a project to being experienced and so does the relative influence on prioritization. It is still the Product Owner's responsibility, but the development team is able to give more information and gain more influence on what should be prioritized.


# Prioritization Lesson Overview:

The Backlog is the work remaining to be done for the product
The backlog should be managed and prioritized according to value and technical complexity
The Product Owner is the primary owner of the backlog
Prioritization is not a simple task; it's complicated and takes a lot of thought and consideration. As you start the journey of prioritizing work, you and your team will make mistakes and that is OK. In Agile, mistakes are embraced because they help the team learn and evolve.
