# Introduction to Backlogs Exercise

Scenario
Scrum Master: Susan
Product Owner: John
Product Ownerâ€™s Boss: Mary

Mary sees Susan in the hallway and tells her about a couple of new features that need to be developed.
Mary asks Susan to add the features to the backlog, prioritize them above everything else and have the team start working on them immediately. 
Susan immediately adds the features to the backlog and calls a meeting with the team and has them start working on the features immediately.

Based on the scenario above, how could Susan have used a more Agile approach to handling Mary's request?
