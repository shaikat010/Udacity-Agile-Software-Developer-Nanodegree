# Introduction to Backlogs Exercise

Scenario
Scrum Master: Susan
Product Owner: John
Product Ownerâ€™s Boss: Mary

Mary sees Susan in the hallway and tells her about a couple of new features that need to be developed.
Mary asks Susan to add the features to the backlog, prioritize them above everything else and have the team start working on them immediately. 
Susan immediately adds the features to the backlog and calls a meeting with the team and has them start working on the features immediately.

Based on the scenario above, how could Susan have used a more Agile approach to handling Mary's request?

# My Solution 

Susan is the scrum master. It is the job of the scrum master to facilitate and let the agile processes occur smoothly. Susan should have consulted wth John, who is the product owner and adding features to the backlof should have been the responsibility of john. SUsan should have focused on facilitaing the discussion with john and the team on the feature and then let john manage the backlog
