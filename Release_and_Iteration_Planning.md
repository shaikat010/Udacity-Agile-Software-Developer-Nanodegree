Lesson Overview - Release and Iteration Planning
In this lesson we will cover Intro to Release and Iteration Planning, Agile Techniques, Scrum Specifics. This will build off the Agile Planning, Prioritization, and Scoping lesson and prepare you for taking on the Project.

## By the End of the Lesson You Will Be Able To:

1. Explain the relationship between release and iteration Planning
2. Identify the outcomes of release and iteration Planning
3. Plan an MVP that delivers value
4. Define a spike
5. Explain and apply timeboxes
6. Apply the Scrum framework to plan a release and a sprint


# Why Does Release and Iteration Planning Matter?

While the product roadmap provides high-level direction for the team, the release and iteration plans provide more tactical directions for the team with the iteration plan being the most tactical of them all. A release is comprised of several iterations. During release planning, the team focuses on groups of user stories or themes like security, reporting, login, dashboards, data clean up, UI enhancements that deliver a working and usable product.

Release and iteration planning expose potential impediments, helps communicate timelines for delivering features, and provides traceability for teams to fix problems when they arise.
Here is an example of a blocker the team might identify in releasing planning: The team is building a travel app and is planning to use a 3rd party company to provide location services, but the contract with that 3rd party has not been signed yet. The team and Product Owner might decide to push the work associated with this feature to a future release when the contract has been signed.

To properly approach release and iteration planning think from the "MVP" perspective: "What is the minimum set of features needed for the product to be successful?"

This perspective is not about avoiding work. Rather, this is about creating and delivering higher quality products and features because the team is focused only on what is needed, and they arenâ€™t distracted by things that don't add value.

To get more tactical from the MVP perspective ask the following:

What themes are we focused on in this release?.
Do the user stories align to deliver a fully functioning feature?
Are the user stories going to result in something not fully functioning yet? If so is this intentional because there is a bigger picture and this is a part of the process?
Does this plan equate to value?


## There are 3 reasons why release and iteration planning matters 

1. Identity potential impediments
2. Communicate with stakeholders and customers
3. Provides traceability

# This bring us to the the development of the --> MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
This is the minimum set of features needed to be successful
