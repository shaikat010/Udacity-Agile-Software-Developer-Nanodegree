# Scoping Final Exercise

# Sceneio

Scenario
A newly-formed development team has just finished a sprint planning meeting. 
They are working on a new sales management product and the upcoming sprint they just planned will be their first sprint.

The product owner Kevin is frustrated about the outcome of the sprint planning meeting because he feels that the team’s estimates were really high
and inaccurate for several stories and the team should be able to commit to doing more work in the sprint because he has really tight timelines to deliver an MVP.

# Question

Based on the proposed scenario:

As the scrum master of this team, please explain to Kevin why you think the team’s estimates are so high?
What he should expect as they move forward into future sprints.


# Answer

As the Product Owner, Kevin is in charge of the product and hence is running out of time so he wants to push the team to develop within the deadline. Since he knows about the upcoming features and stories of the product so he feels that the product cannot be delivered in time. 

Moving forward e should expect similar levels of estimation as the estimation should be only done by the team that is ding the work.
If the team is estimating high that means they feel that the product is difficult and also considering 
that the team is newly formed chances are high that they will factors out the time needed for team formation and other a activities  well.

Example Answers
1. The team’s estimates are high because the team is new. The team is estimating conservatively because they have not worked together before, therefore they haven’t built the trust and understanding to estimate less conservatively. As the team develops trust and understands each other's strengths and weaknesses they will be able to estimate better.
2. The team doesn’t understand the product yet, therefore there are a lot of unknowns. As they begin working on the product and understand what they are building there will be less unknowns and they will have more accurate estimates.
3. The user stories that Kevin the Product Owner provided are too big. In the future he can split or descope user stories to make them smaller so that the team can commit to getting more user stories completed.
