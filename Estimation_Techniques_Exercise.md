# Scenario
You are the scrum master for a development team that is building a mobile budget management application. 
The team is using planning poker to estimate the user stories that will be in the next sprint.
The development team disagrees on the story points for one of the user stories.
Two members of the team think that the story should be 5 points and the other 3 members of the team think that the story should be 3 points.


# Question 
Based on the given scenario:

How you would handle this situation as the scrum master?
Explain why you would handle the situation that way.

# My Solution

This situation needs another round of discussion around the specific story point which is creating misalignment.
After the second round of discussion, the estimation exercise will be done again, if the same issue persists then the user story will get the story point that is higher. 

# Example answer from instructor

Example Answer
If the team can’t agree I would take the conservative approach and make the story 5 points. The Story Points are an estimate not an exact.
Any person on the team could end up working on the story therefore 
I want to take the conservative approach and account for everyone’s perspective on the size, scope, and complexity.
