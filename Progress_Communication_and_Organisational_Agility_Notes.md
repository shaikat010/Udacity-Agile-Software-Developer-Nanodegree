Progress Communication and Organisation Agility

# Progress. Communication and Organisational Agility Introduction

To successfully transform and transition to being Agile, organizations need to have

“Top Down” Support
Deep Technical Knowledge
Acceleration of Critical Programs.
The Air Force is one example where I have witnessed a successful and rapid agile transformation under the leadership of their Chief Software Officer- Nicolas Chaillan.
I credit the Air Force’s success to Nicolas’ amazing Agile communication skills, and you will learn about some of these communication tools throughout this course.

# Progress, Communication and Organisation Agility Stakeholders 

In Agile, there are normally 3 main roles

The Product Owner: also known as the 'voice of the customer.'
The Scrum Master: normally considered the coach of the team.
The team which includes a cross-functional collection of members from the database, developers, technical writers, business analysts, UI experts, testers, automation experts, and anyone else needed to ensure the team is self-sufficient and can do all the work themselves without needing to pass work to another team to complete.
Agile was designed to be used in software, and these roles are more closely align with software development teams. However, Agile can be applied and used far beyond software teams.

One secret for any team to be Agile is having cross-functional teams with all the skills necessary to do the work. Lastly, an even bigger secret is Agile is about a complete organizational change that is entirely focused on the Agile mindset, not software.
