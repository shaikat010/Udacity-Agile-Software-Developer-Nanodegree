Progress Communication and Organisation Agility

# Progress. Communication and Organisational Agility Introduction

To successfully transform and transition to being Agile, organizations need to have

“Top Down” Support
Deep Technical Knowledge
Acceleration of Critical Programs.
The Air Force is one example where I have witnessed a successful and rapid agile transformation under the leadership of their Chief Software Officer- Nicolas Chaillan.
I credit the Air Force’s success to Nicolas’ amazing Agile communication skills, and you will learn about some of these communication tools throughout this course.

# Progress, Communication and Organisation Agility Stakeholders 

In Agile, there are normally 3 main roles

The Product Owner: also known as the 'voice of the customer.'
The Scrum Master: normally considered the coach of the team.
The team which includes a cross-functional collection of members from the database, developers, technical writers, business analysts, UI experts, testers, automation experts, and anyone else needed to ensure the team is self-sufficient and can do all the work themselves without needing to pass work to another team to complete.
Agile was designed to be used in software, and these roles are more closely align with software development teams. However, Agile can be applied and used far beyond software teams.

One secret for any team to be Agile is having cross-functional teams with all the skills necessary to do the work. Lastly, an even bigger secret is Agile is about a complete organizational change that is entirely focused on the Agile mindset, not software.

# Tools and Environment 

Throughout this course, you will be using a laptop and up-to-date web browser along with spreadsheets to do some of the exercises that have been planned for you. Also, a video recording device is optional if you want to record yourself responding to some situations that we will go through. For the project, you will use spreadsheets and slide presentation software.

It is important to note that most metrics will be automatically calculated with the software listed below in an Agile position. However, this course is meant to make sure you have a firm grasp of what these metrics mean, so you'll be calculating many of them in a spreadsheet. This prevents you from becoming familiar with only one toolset and ensures that the tools you use in this course are free to use.

When you are working in an Agile environment, you will use tools such as

Trello(opens in a new tab)
Jira(opens in a new tab)
Confluence(opens in a new tab)
Microsoft's Azure DevOps Service(opens in a new tab) (previously VSTS)
Monday.com(opens in a new tab)
Jenkins(opens in a new tab)
Git(opens in a new tab)
GitHub(opens in a new tab)
There are many more to deliver quality software, but these are all widespread tools.

In this course, you will learn about Progress, Communication, and Organizational Agility. We will cover Agile metrics, and you will get introduced to the various metrics that Agile teams use to monitor health and measure progress, and you will learn how to create those metrics.

Then we will dive deep into different techniques and tools for measuring progress beyond metrics. After that, you will learn how to identify risks and what to do to handle risks once they have been identified. Lastly, you will learn about effective communication in the Agile way!

Note: It is important to understand that the content of this course is meant to build a foundation in understanding Agile. You will not be ready to be a Scrum Master or Agile Coach at the end of the course.

However, these foundational skills and knowledge gained for this course will help you when working as part of an Agile Team, but does not necessarily make you job-ready as an Agile coach or Scrum Master, but provides the foundation to begin moving towards those goals successfully.
