Progress Communication and Organisation Agility

# Progress. Communication and Organisational Agility Introduction

To successfully transform and transition to being Agile, organizations need to have

“Top Down” Support
Deep Technical Knowledge
Acceleration of Critical Programs.
The Air Force is one example where I have witnessed a successful and rapid agile transformation under the leadership of their Chief Software Officer- Nicolas Chaillan.
I credit the Air Force’s success to Nicolas’ amazing Agile communication skills, and you will learn about some of these communication tools throughout this course.
