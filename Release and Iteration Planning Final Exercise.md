# Release and Iteration Planning Final Exercise

# Scenario
A development team has recently decided to change from waterfall to an Agile delivery management process. 
The team is preparing for an upcoming release that contains completed work from 7 sprints. 
To start preparing for the release, the team starts integrating the code from each sprint and they notice hundreds of defects. 
There are more defects than expected and they are afraid that they wonâ€™t be able to fix the defects in time for the release.

# Based on the scenario above:
What agile techniques can the team use to improve future releases?
How should the team handle the defects?

# My Solution
They should use the continuous integration continuous delivery technique (CI/CD)
They defects should be added to the product backlog and in the next sprint should be prioritized by the product owner and then handled by the team. 

# Instructors Solution

It is important to remember that release and iteration plans are tactical roadmaps for the product. The team should continually release the latest versions of the software and testing should be ingrained in the development and release process so that problems can be identified, added to the backlog, prioritized, and fixed earlier. Agile teams using the Scrum framework should leverage the ceremonies and timeboxes to continuously improve the product and the work of the team. No matter what, teams should always work at a sustainable pace and the minimum viable product should be the basis for every release.
