# Release and Iteration Planning Final Exercise

# Scenario
A development team has recently decided to change from waterfall to an Agile delivery management process. 
The team is preparing for an upcoming release that contains completed work from 7 sprints. 
To start preparing for the release, the team starts integrating the code from each sprint and they notice hundreds of defects. 
There are more defects than expected and they are afraid that they wonâ€™t be able to fix the defects in time for the release.

# Based on the scenario above:
What agile techniques can the team use to improve future releases?
How should the team handle the defects?
