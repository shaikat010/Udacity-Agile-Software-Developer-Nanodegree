## Release and Iteration Planning Introduction Exercise
## Scenario

You are the product owner for a fitness product. Three weeks ago, you worked with the development team to finalize the release plan for the next couple of releases. You communicated the release plans to your stakeholders.

Since the time you communicated the plans for the features that are going to be released, 2 members of the development team have accepted new job offers and are planning to leave the company. Another developer will be on paternity leave for 4 weeks.

## Based on the scenario presented, what adjustments if any, should you take as the team’s product owner?

# My Answer
Since the team has had a cutdown in size this means that the velocity of the team is going to belower now. Therefore as the Product Owner I will make scoping changes with consultations with the team to allow for a more digestable plan for the rest of the remaining team.

# Example Answers
The Product Owner should let the stakeholders and investors know that the development team is losing 2 team members which will impact the scope of the features that were planned for upcoming releases.
The Product Owner should work with the stakeholders to re-prioritize the work to deliver the highest value and determine the scope of the “must-have” features for the next releases.
The Product Owner should work with the remaining team members to rescope and replan the work for each release based on the changes to the team and their impact.
The team member going on paternity leave should not have an impact on the release plan because their time away from the team should have been considered during the release planning that took place three weeks ago. The team should be holding each other accountable for communicating expected out of office plans as vacation, paternity/maternity leave, training, military duty, etc because this impacts the teams capacity and the amount of work they can deliver.
