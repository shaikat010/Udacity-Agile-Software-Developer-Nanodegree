Release and Iteration Planning Introduction Exercise
Release and Iteration Planning Introduction Exercise
Scenario
You are the product owner for a fitness product. Three weeks ago, you worked with the development team to finalize the release plan for the next couple of releases. You communicated the release plans to your stakeholders.

Since the time you communicated the plans for the features that are going to be released, 2 members of the development team have accepted new job offers and are planning to leave the company. Another developer will be on paternity leave for 4 weeks.

Based on the scenario presented, what adjustments if any, should you take as the teamâ€™s product owner?

Since the team has had a cutdown in size this means that the velocity of the team is going to belower now. Therefore as the Product Owner I will make scoping changes with consultations with the team to allow for a more digestable plan for the rest of the remaining team.
