# Release and Iteration Planning Introduction Exercise
## Release and Iteration Planning Introduction Exercise
## Scenario

You are the product owner for a fitness product. Three weeks ago, you worked with the development team to finalize the release plan for the next couple of releases. You communicated the release plans to your stakeholders.

Since the time you communicated the plans for the features that are going to be released, 2 members of the development team have accepted new job offers and are planning to leave the company. Another developer will be on paternity leave for 4 weeks.

## Based on the scenario presented, what adjustments if any, should you take as the team’s product owner?

# My Answer
Since the team has had a cutdown in size this means that the velocity of the team is going to belower now. Therefore as the Product Owner I will make scoping changes with consultations with the team to allow for a more digestable plan for the rest of the remaining team.

# Example Answers
The Product Owner should let the stakeholders and investors know that the development team is losing 2 team members which will impact the scope of the features that were planned for upcoming releases.
The Product Owner should work with the stakeholders to re-prioritize the work to deliver the highest value and determine the scope of the “must-have” features for the next releases.
The Product Owner should work with the remaining team members to rescope and replan the work for each release based on the changes to the team and their impact.
The team member going on paternity leave should not have an impact on the release plan because their time away from the team should have been considered during the release planning that took place three weeks ago. The team should be holding each other accountable for communicating expected out of office plans as vacation, paternity/maternity leave, training, military duty, etc because this impacts the teams capacity and the amount of work they can deliver.


# Agile Techniques for Release and Iteration Planning

## Execute on the Plans

1. MVP
2. Velocity
3. Continuous Integration (CI)
4. Continuous Delivery (CD)
5. Managing Risks

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
This is based on 
1. Priority
2. Value
3. Speed to Market
4. Feedback
5. Improvements

## Velocity 

### This is the amount of scope that the team is able to complete each iteration

- This helps the team commit appropriately
- Measured by the average number of story points completed each iteration
- New teams need to complete 3-5 sprints estabish a velocity
- New teams estimate velocity for first 3-5 sprints

# Velocity Equation = Total Number of Story Points / Total Number of Sprints ( unit is points per sprint )

## Agile Approach to Managing Risks

- Risks are threats to a product's success
- Taskle the highest risk, highest value user stories first
- Fail fast mindset
- Prove that we can or cannot do it

## Timeboxes

- A set period of time to complete a work
- Parameter of time helps team avoid spending too much time creating a solution
- Timeboxes results in a working software or proof that a concept will or will not work.

## Spikes

- A timeboxed depp dive that a development team uses to discover or prove if an approach will work
- Used to determine technical and functional approaches
- Risk Management technique

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- The art of frequently integrating a developer's newly built code into the team / product code repository
- Done in a development environment first
- Integrations help discover problems with code faster
- Fix problems faster
- Less problems are rleased

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Perform frequent demo working software to customers
- Frequent release the working software to customer
- Give value earlier and more often
- Receive and implement feedbacks


Teams leverage several Agile techniques to deliver value incrementally. To begin teams and Product Owners plan in a way that results in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Software is never-ending and there are lots of requirements, so the team uses the MVP concept to deliver the minimum set of functionality needed for the Product to be valuable to the customer. With some key values being:

Priority
Bringing Value
Increasing Speed to Market
Getting Feedback
Working on Future Improvements

This approach is not about avoiding work but more about prioritizing work so that the team can focus and deliver high-quality software. Teams also leverage time boxes called spikes to deep dive into problems. Lastly, teams use 2 feedback loops of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to bring attention to problems earlier so that releases are more successful.

Continuous Integration and Delivery
This cycle helps to encourage the practice of frequent updates so that it is faster to navigate issues that come up.

## New Definitions
Continuous Integration - A software development practice in which developers merge code frequently into a shared code repository.
Continuous Delivery - A software development practice in which developers deliver working software frequently and iteratively.
Spike - A time box used by teams to do research, explore a problem, or determine the best solution. Spikes should have a goal and a definitive time box.

Continuous integration and continuous delivery are fundamental Agile techniques that relate to software management practices and there is a lot more to learn about them than we cover in this lesson, but you can dive deeper into them by reading this article from Atlassian(opens in a new tab).
